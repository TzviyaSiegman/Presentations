                    <li>The published article is rather immutable</li>

					<h2>History Lesson</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Digitization of scholarly publishing is about the same age as the Web</li>
					<li>In 1995, libraries didn't want to build additional wings to house stacks of journals</li>
				<li>JSTOR was created to solve a real estate problem</li>
				<li>Earliest online journals were HTML</li>
				<li>The appeal and efficiency of desktop publishing was too good to pass up</li> 
						</ul>
                    <aside class="notes">The HTML is a second-thought, a gateway drug for the PDF. 90% revenue comes from digital, but we still pay for typesetter. </aside>
				</section>

                 <section>
                     <h2>Pages</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Right now, we have a lot of faith in the “page”</li>
					<li>Citations are usually page-based</li>
				  <li>Even when given the choice of HTML, many researchers choose PDF</li> 
						</ul>
                     <aside class="notes">Pages are not bad, but they have become the unit of currency. They are how we review, revise, and cite. They provide easy-to-digest chunks. Problems arise when the page or the format becomes more important than the content.  Yet, we still often create the paginated content first and digital second. HTML is a second-class citizen.</aside>

					<h2>Benefit from the crossroads</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Reap the benefits of pages, or CSS "fragmentainers"</li>
					<li>Don't be contained by the frozen page of desktop publishing</li>
				<li>Publications can be living documents, with typography, supported by the full stack of web technology</li>
		</ul>
				<aside class="notes">We are at a magnificent crossroads now. Ivan will speak more about the opportunities we have to influence the Web. </aside>

					<h2>Connected Publishing</h2>
					<blockquote>Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations.</blockquote>
                    <cite><a href="http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html">Theodor H. Nelson,</a> "Xanalogical Structure, Needed Now More than Ever: 
Parallel Documents, Deep Links to Content, 
Deep Versioning and Deep Re-Use" </cite>
					<aside class="notes">We continue to inherit from the visions of our digital ancestors. Some of the visions are beginning to be realized today. Back in the 1960's Ted Nelson had a vision for interrelated, collaborative content.

                    <p>Cochrane Reviews are systematic reviews of primary research in human health care and health policy, and are internationally recognised as the highest standard in evidence-based health care. They may either investigate the effects of interventions for prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, or alternatively may assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test for a given condition in a specific patient group and setting. <strong style="color: #ced100;">A unique feature of Cochrane Reviews is that they are living documents in that they are updated with new evidence that emerges. They were conceived as electronic publications from the outset, and designed to take advantage of features unique to electronic publishing.</strong></p>
