                    <ul>
                    <li>Historically, publishing research meant publishing a flat, finished product</li>
                    <li>Articles have been read by our peers before and after publication</li>
                    <li>The published article is rather immutable</li> 
                    </ul>

					<h2>History Lesson</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Digitization of scholarly publishing is about the same age as the Web</li>
					<li>In 1995, libraries didn't want to build additional wings to house stacks of journals</li>
				<li>JSTOR was created to solve a real estate problem</li>
				<li>Earliest online journals were HTML</li>
				<li>The appeal and efficiency of desktop publishing was too good to pass up</li> 
						</ul>
				</section>

                 <section>
                     <h2>Pages</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Right now, we have a lot of faith in the “page”</li>
					<li>Citations are usually page-based</li>
				  <li>Even when given the choice of HTML, many researchers choose PDF</li> 
						</ul>
                     <aside class="notes">Pages are not bad. They provide easy-to-digest chunks. Problems arise when the page or the format becomes more important than the content.</aside>
				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2>Benefit from the crossroads</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Reap the benefits of pages, or CSS "fragmentainers"</li>
					<li>Don't be contained by the frozen page of desktop publishing</li>
				<li>Publications can be living documents supported by the full stack of web technology</li>
		</ul>
				<aside class="notes">We are at a magnigicent crossroads now. Ivan will speak more about the opportunities we have to influence the Web. </aside>

					<h2>Connected Publishing</h2>
					<blockquote>Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations.</blockquote>
                    <cite><a href="http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html">Theodor H. Nelson,</a> "Xanalogical Structure, Needed Now More than Ever: 
Parallel Documents, Deep Links to Content, 
Deep Versioning and Deep Re-Use" </cite>
					<aside class="notes">We continue to inherit from the visions of our digital ancestors. Some of the visions are beginning to be realized today. Back in the 1960's Ted Nelson had a vision for interrelated, collaborative content.

                    <ul>
                    <li>Hypertext is "branching and responding text". (Ted Nelson)</li>
                    <li>Early systems linked objects, so when objects moved, links moved with them</li>
                    <li>The Web we ended up with is one variation of the many visions that could have succeeded</li>
                </ul>

					<ul>
						<li><strong style="color: #9eb597;">Hypertext</strong> gives us a lot of the same information as print and a protocol for sharing it</li>
						<li><strong style="color: #9eb597;">Hypermedia</strong> gives us an interactive layer</li>

                    <li>We are still looking for the best way to convey "deeply intertwingled" information</li>
                    <li>Traditional links rot. Is there a better way to convey relationships?</li>
                    <li>Can information from one resource change or affect something in another resource?</li>
                    <li>Is it possible to add information to a resource without touching it?</li>

                     <ul>   
                    <li>We can convey metadata and relational information without tweaking the content. </li>
                    <li>Associated resources can relay information from one location to another and effect behavior </li>
